### Blackjack Rules
Welcome to Blackjack! Your goal is to reach a hand value close to 21 without exceeding it. Here's a quick guide:

1. **Investment:**
   - Start by betting a virtual amount.

2. **Dealing Cards:**
   - Press "Deal" to get started.
   - You and the dealer receive two cards each.

3. **Player's Move:**
   - Decide whether to "stand" or "hit" based on your cards.

4. **Dealer's Move:**
   - If you stand, dealer's face-down card is revealed.
   - If you hit, dealer's cards remain hidden.

5. **Determining the Winner:**
   - Closest to 21 wins without busting.
   - If both tied, it's a push.
     
6. **Blackjack:**
   - Ace and 10-point card is Blackjack, usually winning.

7. **Play More Rounds:**
   - Keep playing with new rounds.

8. **Exit:**
   - End the game when you're ready.

Remember, Blackjack is about strategic decisions. Good luck!
